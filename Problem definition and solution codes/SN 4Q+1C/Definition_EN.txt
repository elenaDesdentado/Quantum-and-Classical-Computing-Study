There is a number that must be discovered. For this matter, there is a function, as a black box that takes some bits that represent a number as input and returns a bit, 0 or 1 to express if this number has been discovered or not. In this case the codification of the number in binary takes 4 bits/qubits and there is an extra bit/qubit which indicates if the solution has been reached.
